Understanding source code is fundamental in software development.
Our formative study found that descriptions and review comments in pull requests on GitHub have useful information for code understanding; however, they are underutilized for that purpose.
Our system, CodeGlass, shows pull requests and review comments associated with the user-selected code piece (a portion of code).
The backend algorithm we build based on the LHDiff method identifies past commits that include changes on the given code piece.
It then returns a series of pull requests containing these commits.
Our algorithm evaluation reveals that our backtrack can achieve high precision and recall to backtrack changes on a code piece and extract related commits.
Our user study also shows that CodeGlass was effective to support comprehension related to implementation rationales and development history about a code piece.
Informal expert review uncovers different potential benefits of CodeGlass in professional development environments.
% In this paper we explain the design and implementation of CodeGlass.
